      <description>This section provides instructions on how to configure cloud storage devices for KubeSphere in a production environment.
 To configure cloud storage devices, create an API key in the cloud environment and set up KubeSphere using the API key to integrate with the cloud environment through the Container Storage Interface (CSI). When users create volumes in KubeSphere and mount them to pods, KubeSphere will automatically create storage devices in the cloud environment for pods to use.</description>

      <description>NeonSAN is an enterprise-grade distributed block storage system developed by QingCloud. NeonSAN CSI is a storage plugin provided by the NeonSAN team for Kubernetes, which enables dynamic provisioning of persistent storage volumes on the Kubernetes platform.
 This section explains how to configure NeonSAN CSI for KubeSphere clusters in a production environment.
 Prerequisites   NeonSAN v2.2.0 or above has been successfully deployed, and each node in the container cluster is connected to NeonSAN by the installed QBD.</description>

      <description>This section describes how to configure Network File System (NFS) for the KubeSphere cluster in a production environment.
     Note     NFS is incompatible with some applications (such as Prometheus), which may cause pod creation failure. If you do need to use NFS in a production environment, make sure you understand the risks or consult KubeSphere technical support at support@kubesphere.cloud.
    Build NFS Server Before configuring NFS for KubeSphere, you need to set up an NFS server first.</description>
